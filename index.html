        <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>

        <p>Hi, I'm Brian. I am an aspiring web developer.</p>
        <p>I am currently working towards my AAS Degree in Web Development at Wake Tech Community College. In my courses,
          I am learning to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, my coursework includes
          courses in PHP, Python, C#, the MERN Stack, React App, Active Server Pages, and SQL. I hope to find a career where I can use the skills that 
          I am gaining to create responsive, user-friendly, accessible websites. 
        </p>
